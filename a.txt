In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their leaves a gentle fold.

The river flows, a silver stream,
Through valleys green, where wildflowers beam.
Their petals dancing in the breeze,
A colorful tapestry, if you please.

The mountains rise, a rugged shore,
Where eagles soar, and wolves roam once more.
Their majestic forms, a wondrous sight,
A testament to nature's might.

The sun sets slow, a fiery ball,
Painting the sky with colors all.
The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
A night of rest, under starry light.

In this world of wonder, we are free,
Connected to the earth, wild and carefree.
Let us cherish nature's beauty rare,
And strive to preserve it, without a single snare.
