In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their leaves a gentle fold.

The wind stirs, and the branches sway,
As if in rhythm with Nature's way.
The sun's last rays upon the ground,
 Illuminate the world around.

In this still moment, I am free,
A part of something greater than me.
The earth's sweet fragrance fills the air,
As petals bloom, and trees preside there.

The river's voice, a gentle hush,
Echoes through the valley's rush.
The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
In the evening sky's soft, silvery light.

Nature's beauty, pure and true,
Inspires my soul, and sees me through.
A world of wonder, full of might,
Where love and awe take flight.
